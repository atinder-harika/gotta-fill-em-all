"Gotta File 'Em All: The Gamified Accessibility Companion"

Target Theme: Hack for Accessibility (Focus 1 & 3)

Demo Target: IRCC Study Permit Extension Form


1. Executive Summary
The Pitch: Government websites are the "Final Boss" for people with ADHD (Cognitive) and
Dyslexia (Neuro). They are dense, confusing, and unforgiving.

The Solution: A Gamified Browser Extension that overlays a familiar "Trainer & Creature" Duo
onto the IRCC portal. They read the text, simplify the jargon, and turn filling out a Study Permit
into an RPG quest to "Evolve Your Companion."

The Goal: Win "Best Accessibility," "Best Use of Gemini," and the Grand Prize by turning a
painful citizen experience into a joyful, nostalgic adventure.

Theme Alignment:
    ●​ Focus 1 (Social & Systemic Access): Breaking down barriers to essential services for
       Newcomers via multi-language/accent support.
    ●​ Focus 3 (Cognitive & Neuro Accessibility): Reducing executive dysfunction through
       gamification (XP/Evolution) and simplified instructions.

2. Winning the Judges (Scoring Strategy)
This project is engineered to max out the Hackville Rubric:

|

| Criteria | Pts | Strategy |

| Adherence to Theme | 10 | We directly address Cognitive Load. The "Trainer" acts as an
executive function prosthesis. |

| Originality | 10 | We are merging Nostalgic Gaming (Pokemon-style) with Civic Tech. It’s
"Pokemon meets TurboTax." |
| Impact | 10 | We address a massive industry problem: Newcomers failing immigration
forms due to complexity. |

| UX Execution | 5 | The "Side Panel" UI keeps the user focused. The "Evolution" mechanic
provides a tangible dopamine reward. |

| Technical Execution | 5 | The "Trojan Horse" architecture (Next.js inside Extension) ensures
a stable demo. We use RAG + Voice + Vector Search. |


3. The "Parody Pokemon" Theme (Familiarity + Safety)
Concept: Leverage the "Ash & Pikachu" dynamic for instant emotional connection, but use
"Parody" versions to avoid IP strikes.
 ●​ The Trainer: "Ashly (The Advocate)"
    ○​ Role: The Logic/Brain. Explains the rules, translates legalese, and guides the user.
    ○​ Voice (ElevenLabs): Energetic, youthful. Crucial: Can switch accents (e.g., Indian
       English, Filipino English) to make newcomers feel at home.
    ○​ Visual: Blue vest, red hat (classic trainer vibe).
 ●​ The Creature: "Pik-A-Boo (The Spark)"
    ○​ Role: The Hype/Evolution.
    ○​ Evolution Mechanic: Starts as a small "Spark Egg." As you fill fields, it cracks. At
       50% form completion, it becomes "Pik-A-Boo" (Small Mouse). At 100%, it evolves
       into "Volt-Beaver" (Big Hero).
    ○​ Voice: Cute squeaks that get deeper/stronger as it evolves.

4. The "Trojan Horse" Architecture
The Strategy: Chrome Side Panel Extension loading a Next.js 15 app.

The Stack (Golden Stack Adapted)
 1.​ The Brain (Next.js 15): Runs on DigitalOcean. Handles Gemini logic, RAG retrieval.
 2.​ The Window (Chrome Side Panel): manifest.json wrapper.
 3.​ The Eyes (Content Script): Injected into canada.ca. Reads text, finds inputs, sends to
     Side Panel.
 4.​ The Memory (MongoDB Atlas): Vector Search for user documents (Passport, Letter of
     Acceptance).
 5.​ The Voice (ElevenLabs):
     ○​ Input: Speech-to-Text (User asks "What is a UCI number?").
     ○​ Output: Text-to-Speech (Ashly explains it).

5. Core Features & "The Duo" Logic
Feature A: "Bureaucracy Vision" (Cognitive Access)
●​ Action: User clicks a confusing term (e.g., "Designated Learning Institution Number").
●​ Ashly (Gemini): "That's just the school's ID number! Check your Letter of Acceptance in
   the Pokedex."
●​ Voice: Ashly speaks this out loud (ElevenLabs).

Feature B: "Secure RAG & Simulated Autofill" (Priority Feature)
●​ Concept: Instead of brittle programmatic autofill, we use a "Guide & Assist" model.
●​ The Interaction:
   1.​ Form asks for "DLI Number."
   2.​ Ashly searches the uploaded PDF (RAG).
   3.​ Ashly says: "I found it! It's O1937423."
   4.​ UI Action: Ashly presents a "Copy" button.
   5.​ Visual Cue: When user hovers the "Copy" button, the actual input field on the
       government website glows Gold (via Content Script).
   6.​ User clicks Copy -> Pastes into the glowing box.

Feature C: "Evolution Gamification" (The Hook)
●​ Mechanic:
   ○​ Fill Name field -> +10 XP -> Egg shakes.
   ○​ Fill Address -> +10 XP -> Egg cracks.
   ○​ Complete Section 1 -> EVOLUTION ANIMATION (CSS/Lottie).
●​ Why: Turns boring data entry into a "Level Up" game.

Feature D: "The Universal Translator" (Newcomer Focus)
●​ Action: User selects "Accent: Indian English" in settings.
●​ Tech: ElevenLabs API updates the voice model ID for Ashly.
●​ Impact: Reduces anxiety for non-native speakers by hearing a familiar voice.

6. Technical Implementation Guide (24-Hour Sprint)
Phase 1: The "Trojan Horse" (Hours 0-2)
●​ Build Next.js app.
●​ Create manifest.json to load http://localhost:3000 in Side Panel.

Phase 2: RAG & Gemini (Hours 2-8)
●​ Ingest: API route to upload PDF -> langchain split -> MongoDB Vector Store.
●​ Retrieve: When user asks "What is my UCI?", query MongoDB -> Gemini Answer.

Phase 3: The "Eyes" & Highlight Logic (Hours 8-12)
●​ content.js listens for message HIGHLIGHT_FIELD: "UCI_Number".
●​ Script finds <input name="uci"> (or similar ID) and applies style="border: 4px solid
   #FFD700; box-shadow: 0 0 10px gold;".
 ●​ This visual link between the "Chat" and the "Form" is the key demo moment.

Phase 4: Gamification & Polish (Hours 12-20)
 ●​ Add Lottie animations for the "Evolution."
 ●​ Implement ElevenLabs streaming for instant voice feedback.

7. Future Roadmap (The "24h Reality Check")
 ●​ Agentic Browser Control: "In the future, Ashly will click the 'Next' button and navigate
    pages for you. For now, she guides you."
 ●​ Full API Auto-Fill: "We will integrate directly with CRA API (MyAccount) to pre-fill
    everything without copy-paste."
 ●​ Real Life Rewards: "Exchange XP for discounts on Passport fees."
